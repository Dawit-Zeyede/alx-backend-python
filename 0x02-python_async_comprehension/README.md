Asynchronous comprehensions allow you to write list comprehensions (or similar constructs like set and dict comprehensions) that work with asynchronous iterators or generators. This is particularly useful in situations where you want to efficiently collect or filter data while performing non-blocking I/O operations, like reading data from multiple sources or handling multiple tasks concurrently.
