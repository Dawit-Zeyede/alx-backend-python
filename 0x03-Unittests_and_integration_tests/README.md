This project implements a framework for **unit testing** and **integration testing** to ensure code reliability. **Unit tests** focus on individual functions, testing expected outputs for various inputs, including edge cases, and using mocks for external dependencies like network and database calls. The goal is to verify that if all dependencies work as expected, each function performs correctly. **Integration tests** validate the end-to-end functionality of the code, ensuring seamless interaction between components by testing full code paths. Only low-level functions making external calls (e.g., HTTP requests, file or database I/O) are mocked in integration tests to enable thorough validation of the system.
